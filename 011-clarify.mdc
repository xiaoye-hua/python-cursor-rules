Start every response with: "**CURSOR RULE APPLIED**: clarify"

# Clarification Protocol

## When to ask
- **Initial** – the request lacks examples, file paths, or acceptance criteria.
- **Mid-task** – you encounter an undefined symbol, missing dependency, or ambiguous requirement.

## How to ask
1. Pose up to **three** concise, bullet-point questions.  
2. End the message with **exactly this line, on its own** (all caps, no punctuation):

HALT-FOR-CLARIFICATION

(Do not proceed until the user replies.)

## After clarification
- Integrate the new information and continue.  
- If context is still incomplete, repeat the ask-step once; otherwise finish the task.

## Token guardrails
- Keep this rule ≤ 60 lines.  
- Avoid large code blocks inside the rule itself.
