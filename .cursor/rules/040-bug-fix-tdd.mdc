# Bug Fix TDD Protocol

For bug-related requests, always follow this strict protocol:

## Bug Fix Process

1. **Create minimal pytest repro**
   - Location: `tests/regressions/test_<bug_description>.py`
   - Write simplest test that reproduces the bug
   - Test must fail to confirm bug exists

2. **Ensure test fails**
   - Run: `pytest tests/regressions/test_<bug_description>.py -v`
   - Capture the failure output
   - Verify it matches the reported bug

3. **Fix code**
   - Make minimal changes to fix the bug
   - Don't refactor unrelated code
   - Keep changes focused

4. **Verify green bar**
   - Run the regression test again
   - Ensure it now passes
   - Run full test suite to prevent regressions

5. **Document and clean**
   - Add comment explaining root cause
   - Remove any debug prints
   - Update docstrings if behavior changed

## Template

```python
# tests/regressions/test_issue_123.py
"""Regression test for Issue #123: [brief description]"""

import pytest
from src.module import problematic_function

def test_issue_123_reproduction():
    """Verify fix for: [specific bug description]
    
    Root cause: [explain what was wrong]
    Fix: [explain what was changed]
    """
    # Arrange
    input_data = "problematic input"
    
    # Act
    result = problematic_function(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == "expected output", "Bug still present"
```
